STM32 HID device for arcade builds

Compound HID device containing keyboard, mouse, two joysticks and a virtual com port. Plug into a retropie or something and wire cool buttons and joysticks and whatnot.

See /cad - here you'll find a reference design with 26 pins for an STM32F1 128kB flash variant. Any STM32F1 board would do, as long as pin-headers are broken out.

Each pin can be configured with combinations of a keyboard keypress, mouse movement or click, or joystick movement or button press.

Every pin can hold up to eight different combinations. There is also ternary support meaning a pin's config can change depending on if another pin is active or not.

Accelerators for mouse and joystick are supported.

Everything is configured in the command line interface, either via UART pins or via virtual com port.

Different configurations can be saved and loaded, using the internal flash of the STM32F1 (128 kb variant) - no extra storage chip needed.

Depends on pellepl/generic_embedded and pellepl/niffs.

Now also with the Annoyatron support, drive your friends mad...

CLI pin definition examples
===========================
```
// define pin 1 to send keyboard character A
def pin1 = a
// define pin 2 to move mouse up
def pin2 = mouse_y(-1)
// define pin 3 to move mouse right if pin 4 is pressed else left
def pin3 = pin4 ? mouse_x(1) : mouse_x(-1)
// define pin 5 to send keyboard sequence CTRL+ALT+DEL
def pin5 = LEFT_CTRL LEFT_ALT DELETE
```

For certain definitions, numerators are possible. A numerators normally tells how much to move something, e.g. a mouse or joystick. In addition, all numerators can have accelerators, meaning the control will move more and more over time.
A numerator ```<num>``` is defined as  ```(ACC)[(+)|-][1..127]```.

```
// move joystick 10 steps right on x axis
def pin7 = joy1_x(10)
// move joystick accelerating from 1 to 10 steps right on x axis
def pin8 = joy1_x(ACC10)
// and left
def pin8 = joy1_x(ACC-10)
```

Accelerator speed is controlled by cli commands
```
set_mouse_pos_acc
set_mouse_wheel_acc
set_joy_acc
```

Following is a list of all definitions possible.

## Building ##

Make sure you clone subdirectories.

```
human-entity@machine ~$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/pellepl/arcadehid
```

You'll need an arm toolchain, let's say it lies in `/home/human-entity/toolchain/arm-none-eabi-toolchain-gcc-6.3.0`.
Then you simply do this:
```
human-entity@machine ~$ cd arcadehid
human-entity@machine ~/arcadehid$ make clean
human-entity@machine ~/arcadehid$ CROSS_COMPILE=/home/human-entity/toolchain/arm-none-eabi-toolchain-gcc-6.3.0/bin/arm-none-eabi- make all
```

Alternatively. you tinker a bit with the makefile.

This will produce target files in elf, binary, and ihex flavours.
